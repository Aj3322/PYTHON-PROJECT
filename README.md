# PYTHON-PROJECT
# Central Tendency and Dispersion Calculator

This Python program is a graphical calculator built using Tkinter, enabling users to compute measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range) based on a set of input numbers.

## Overview

The code features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter that allows users to perform the following actions:

- Enter numbers into the provided text box.
- Choose the type of central tendency calculation (Arithmetic Mean, Median, Mode) or dispersion calculation (Variance, Standard Deviation, Range) using the radio buttons.
- Click the corresponding "Calculate" buttons to obtain the result for the selected measure.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `central_dispersion_calculator.py`.
2. The GUI window will open, providing an interface for performing calculations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries: `tkinter`, `pandas`, `statistics`

## Important Notes

- Ensure to input valid numerical data for accurate calculations.
- When calculating the mode, if multiple modes exist or no mode is present, the program may return an error.

## File Structure

- `central_dispersion_calculator.py`: The main Python script containing the GUI application code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing information about the program.


### How to Use the Central Tendency and Dispersion Calculator

#### 1. **Setup and Requirements**

- **Python Installation**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org).

- **Install Required Libraries**: The script utilizes certain Python libraries. To install them, open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

    ```
    pip install pandas
    ```

#### 2. **Running the Application**

- **Download the Code**: Obtain the `central_dispersion_calculator.py` file or clone the repository from GitHub to your local system.

- **Run the Script**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the `central_dispersion_calculator.py` is located, and execute:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

    This command will start the application and launch a graphical window displaying the calculator.

#### 3. **Using the Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

- **Entering Numbers**:
    - Enter numerical values into the provided text box, separated by spaces. For instance: `5 10 15 20`.

- **Central Tendency Calculation**:
    - Choose the desired type of central tendency (Mean, Median, Mode) by selecting the respective radio button.
    - Click the "Calculate Central Tendency" button.
    - The result will appear in the display area below as "Central Tendency Result".

- **Dispersion Calculation**:
    - Choose the desired type of dispersion (Variance, Standard Deviation, Range) using the respective radio button.
    - Click the "Calculate Dispersion" button.
    - The result will be displayed in the area labeled "Dispersion Result".

#### 4. **Important Notes**

- **Valid Numerical Input**:
    - Ensure the entered numbers are valid numerical values to obtain accurate calculations.

- **Mode Calculation**:
    - When calculating the mode, the program might encounter issues if multiple modes exist or no mode is present in the given dataset.

#### 5. **File Structure**

- `central_dispersion_calculator.py`: The Python script containing the code for the GUI application.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing information about the program for users.
